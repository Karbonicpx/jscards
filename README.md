<h2>📌 About the Project</h2>

<p>
This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, local state management, responsive layouts, and component-based thinking using only vanilla web technologies.
</p>

<p>
The flashcards are simple objects stored in JavaScript, and the app calculates progress by tracking which cards have been viewed.  
A custom progress bar visually shows how far the user has progressed through the deck.
